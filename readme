This is will we will store our code, communication should be down over slack.
Everything we need to do to complete milestone 1 can be found in the issues subfolder.
The hospital data is stored here.
As for MYSQL fomration I will be posting a Relational model for that
Below is the other requirement from the Milestone document
The application is entirely MVC in Fuel PHP, no static pages.  Pages use templates for navigation and other common elements and are designed and implemented to be as generic as possible.
It is up to the group how the different pages are broken up into controllers and actions, provided the actions are parameterized for MPN and DRG for the respective detail pages.
The application will use no fewer than 3 models, Hospital, DRG, and Payment, which will read the respective data using the fuel model search commands.  At this stage, the models will read from a one or more files.
